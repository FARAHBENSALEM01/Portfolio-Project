-- Exploratory Data Analysis

-- 1) Situation:
--  working on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Apple Store Apps data.
-- The dataset included information about various mobile apps available on the Apple Store.
-- 2) Task:
-- My specific task was to gain insights from the dataset using SQL queries.
-- I wanted to explore app genres, ratings, and other relevant factors.
-- 3) Action:
-- Here are the actions I took:
-- Leveraged SQL techniques to analyze the data.
-- Checked for missing values in key Columns.
-- Explored the NUMBER OF APPS PER GENRE.
-- Reviewed app ratings and other relevant features.
-- looking if there is a correlation between the Length of the App Description and the user_ratings 
-- 4) Result:
-- Key insights from my analysis:
-- Paid apps tend to have higher ratings than free apps.
-- Apps supporting 10-30 languages achieve better ratings.
-- Finance and book apps exhibit lower average ratings.
-- App descriptionsâ€™ length correlates with user ratings.
-- Aspiring developers should aim for an average rating above 3.5.

/*Here we are going to explore the Data and see what will help us to answer our insights */
CREATE TABLE appleStore_description_combined AS

SELECT *
FROM appleStore_description

UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM appleStore_description1

UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM appleStore_description2

UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM appleStore_description3

UNION ALL

SELECT *
FROM appleStore_description4

-- 1) explore the number of unique id's in both tables (appleApple_Store & appleappleStore_description_combined).

-- Apple_Store:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS UNIQUEAPPIDS
FROM Apple_Store;

-- appleStore_description_combined:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS UNIQUEAPPIDS
FROM appleStore_description_combined;

-- 2) looking for any missing values in key columns.

-- Apple_Store:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS MISSING_VALUES
FROM Apple_Store
WHERE track_name IS NULL OR user_rating IS NULL OR prime_genre IS NULL;

-- appleStore_description_combined:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS MISSIN_GVALUES
FROM appleStore_description_combined
WHERE track_name IS NULL OR app_desc IS NULL;

-- 3) LOOKING FOR THE NUMBER OF APPS PER GENRE.

-- Apple_Store:

SELECT prime_genre, COUNT(*) AS Countapps
FROM Apple_Store
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY Countapps DESC;

-- 4) MAX, MIN, AVG of Rating

SELECT
	MAX(user_rating) AS MAX_rating,
	MIN(user_rating) AS MIN_rating,
	AVG(user_rating) AS AVG_rating
FROM Apple_Store;  
  
-- Insights

-- 1) find out whether the paid apps rating is higher than the free apps.

SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN price > 0 THEN 'Paid'
    ELSE 'free'
END AS APPS_RATING,
    AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple_Store
GROUP BY APPS_RATING;

-- 2) looking if Apps with more supported languages have higher ratings.

SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN lang_num < 10 THEN '< 10 languages'
    WHEN lang_num between 10 and 30 THEN '10 - 30 languages'
    ELSE '>30 languages'
END AS Supp_Languages,
    AVG(user_rating) AS Avg_rating
FROM Apple_Store
GROUP BY Supp_Languages
order by Avg_rating DESC;

-- 3) looking for genres with low ratings 

SELECT prime_genre, AVG(user_rating) as AVG_Rating
FROM Apple_Store
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY AVG_Rating ASC;

/* users gave bad rating for some categories like catalogs, finance meaning that they are not satisfied 
so there might be good opportunity to create an app in this categories */ 

-- 4) looking if there is a correlation between the Length of the App Description and the user_ratings 

SELECT 
CASE
	WHEN length(app_desc) < 500 THEN 'Short'
	WHEN length(app_desc) BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 THEN 'Medium'
	ELSE 'Long' 
END AS DESC_LENGTH, 
	AVG(user_rating) AS AVG_Rating
FROM Apple_Store
JOIN appleStore_description_combined
ON Apple_Store.id = appleStore_description_combined.id
GROUP BY DESC_LENGTH
ORDER BY AVG_Rating ASC;

/* THE LONGER THE DESCRIPTION THE HIGHER THE RATING*/ 

-- 5) looking for the top_rated App for each genre, which means we need the rank

WITH TOP_RATED_APPS AS
(
SELECT
	prime_genre, 
	track_name,
	user_rating,
   RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY prime_genre ORDER BY user_rating DESC) AS Rank
FROM Apple_Store
  ) 
SELECT   	
	prime_genre,
	track_name,
	user_rating 
FROM TOP_RATED_APPS
WHERE RANK = 1
GROUP BY prime_genre;
